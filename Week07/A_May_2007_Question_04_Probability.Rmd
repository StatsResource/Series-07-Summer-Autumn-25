 A man wins a rupee for head and loses a rupee for tail when a fair coin is tossed. Suppose that he tosses once and quits if he wins; but tries once more if he losses on the first toss. What are his expected winnings?

Let's break down the problem to find the expected winnings step by step:

### Steps and Solution:

1. **Possible outcomes and their respective probabilities:**
   - **A**: Heads on the first toss. 
     - Probability: \(P(A) = \frac{1}{2}\) 
     - Earnings: \(E(X|A) = 1\) rupee
   - **B**: Tails on the first toss and heads on the second toss.
     - Probability: \(P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}\) 
     - Earnings: \(E(X|B) = 1 - 1 = 0\) rupees
   - **C**: Tails on both tosses.
     - Probability: \(P(C) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}\) 
     - Earnings: \(E(X|C) = -1 - 1 = -2\) rupees

2. **Expected winnings calculation:**
   \[
   E(X) = P(A)E(X|A) + P(B)E(X|B) + P(C)E(X|C)
   \]
   Substituting the probabilities and earnings:
   \[
   E(X) = \left(\frac{1}{2} \times 1\right) + \left(\frac{1}{4} \times 0\right) + \left(\frac{1}{4} \times -2\right)
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   E(X) = \frac{1}{2} + 0 + \left(\frac{-2}{4}\right)
   \]
   \[
   E(X) = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2}
   \]
   \[
   E(X) = 0
   \]

---
So, the man's expected winnings are **0 rupees**.
